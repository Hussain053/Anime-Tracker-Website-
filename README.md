The Anime Tracker is a responsive front-end web application designed to provide a smooth and engaging experience for anime enthusiasts. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the website follows a modern web design approach with a clean and intuitive interface.

Key features include a fully responsive layout that adapts to all screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices. The site supports dark and light mode toggling, enhancing accessibility and user preference. JavaScript has been used to add smooth transitions and dynamic interactivity, giving the website a modern, animated feel.

Users can explore a curated Top Anime List to discover popular shows, and a submission form is included where visitors can enter their favorite anime titles. An attractive navigation bar makes the site easy to explore, with clear structure and modern design elements.

This project highlights core front-end development skills like responsive design, UI/UX principles, DOM manipulation, and interactivity using vanilla JavaScript. It demonstrates an understanding of modern website aesthetics, form handling, and user-centered design.
